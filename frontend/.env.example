# This file is for local development environment variables.
# For production, these values are typically injected at build time or by the hosting environment.

# Base URL for the backend API.
# When running frontend via `npm run dev` (outside Docker), this should point to your backend.
# If your backend is running locally on port 8080 (e.g., via docker-compose), use:
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080/api

# When deploying with Docker, the VITE_API_BASE_URL is passed as a build argument
# and usually points to the internal Docker service name or a publicly accessible URL.
